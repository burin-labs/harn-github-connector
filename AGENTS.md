# AGENTS.md

Pure-Harn GitHub App connector for inbound webhooks and outbound REST/GraphQL
calls.

Shared connector authoring rules live in the Harn guide:

- [Connector authoring guide](https://github.com/burin-labs/harn/blob/main/docs/src/connectors/authoring.md)

Put shared connector guidance in the Harn guide and keep only
provider-specific notes and local hazards here.

`CLAUDE.md` points here. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## Provider notes

- Webhook verification uses `X-Hub-Signature-256` over the raw request body with the configured
  GitHub App webhook secret.
- Outbound installation-token flow depends on GitHub App credentials: app id,
  private key, and installation id. Keep token refresh behavior aligned with
  GitHub App expiry semantics.
- A typed `github-sdk-harn` would be a separate package; this connector should not grow generated
  REST endpoint definitions.

## Ecosystem working agreement

- Build ambitious outcomes behind small typed interfaces; give behavior one owner
  and generate or parity-test projections instead of duplicating policy.
- Work autonomously within approved scope. Pause for destructive or production effects,
  exceptional spend, material ambiguity, or new authority.
- Treat stop, wait, stand down, pivot, and steer as control events.
- Use the smallest owning product-path check. Add a falsifier for contested, load-bearing,
  or potentially vacuous claims; record controls, recovery, and blind spots.
- Evidence follows source/artifact identity. Reuse proof when relevant code, build inputs,
  and dependencies are unchanged. Repeat affected checks for relevant changes, failures,
  deployment, or packaging differences. Do not rebuild or recapture solely for main.
- Ship means owning-main integration with terminal merge and applicable release/deploy
  checks. Confirm landed content and result; an open PR is incomplete.
- Use `ship` with a deployed Smart Ship caller; otherwise use `gh pr merge --squash --auto`.
  Never use `--admin`; incidents use `bypass-ci`, `bypass-merge-queue`, or `force-merge`.
